% define a function to compute the transformation matrices for a 3-linked
% arm in 2D, the length of each link is L, rotation angles are t1, t2 and
% t3. A01, A12 and A13 are the homogenous transformation matrices between
% frame0,1, frame 1,2 and frame2, 3 and T03 is transformation between
% frame0, 3

function [A01,A12,A23,T03]=FK_3link(t1,t2,t3,L)

A01 = [];


A12 = [];
